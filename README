Kuvela STK Interface

This is a JPA based project.

It has entity classes for the three Kuvela workflows as well as their controllers.
Before anything, remember to create the database from the kuvela.sql script
You need to edit the database server's username and password on the persistence.xml file under Kuvela/build/classes/META-INF

Change to the Kuvela root directory and run ant
The interface can be run as a stand alone by changing to the Kuvela/dist folder and running.. java -jar Kuvela.jar

Or you can use the Netbeans IDE to open and edit your files

To reuse the interface from other applications you need to call the readMessages() method from the MessageReader class
With the RXTX libraries configured and the following jar files copied to the jre/lib/ext folder, 

Kuvela.jar
beansbinding-1.2.1.jar
eclipselink-2.2.0.jar
eclipselink-javax.persistence-2.0.jar
jxl.jar
log4j-1.2.6.jar
mysql-connector-java-5.1.13-bin.jar
RXTXcomm.jar

import org.medicmobile.projects.desktop.kuvela.reader.MessageReader;

and start reading messages like this

try
{
	MessageReader reader = new MessageReader("port goes here...");
	reader.readMessages();
}
catch(Exception e)
{
	// do something with the exception!!
}

There are several other public methods good to know about from the org.medicmobile.projects.desktop.kuvela.controllers.KuvelaControllersInterface class
These are the methods that will be heavily called by the client UI.. thinlets, web pages, swing frames etc
